function clft = xblocks_library_forwarding_table
% Returns a forwarding table suitable for use with xblocks_library.mdl.
% 
% This script is intended to make it easier to rearrange the xblocks_library
% library.  "clft" is a cell array of two-element cell arrays, each of
% which specifies the old and new path of a block that has moved.
%
% To update the forwarding table of xblocks_library.mdl, simply run...
%
% set_param('xblocks_library';'ForwardingTable',xblocks_library_forwarding_table);
%
% ...which will completely overwrite the value of the ForwardingTable
% parameter of the xblocks_library library with the value returned by this
% function.
%
% Don't forget to unlock xblocks_library beforehand!
% Don't forget to save xblocks_library afterwards!
